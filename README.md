# **Reinforcement Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of hands-on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** projects, each focused on implementing and analyzing different algorithms and environments from the textbook **Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction** by Sutton & Barto.

The goal of this repository is to develop a deeper understanding of:
- ✅ Agent learning and policy optimization
- ✅ Environment dynamics and reward mechanisms
- ✅ Exploration-exploitation tradeoffs
- ✅ On-policy vs. off-policy learning

---

## 🧠 **Projects Overview**

Each project explores a specific RL concept or algorithm, and includes its own `README.md` with:
- **Objectives** – What the project aims to demonstrate
- **Methodology** – Core algorithms and environment setup
- **Key Results** – Visualizations, learning curves, and observations

---

## 📂 **Current Projects**


- [blackjack](./blackjack/) – Policy evaluation using Monte Carlo
- [gambler-problem](./gambler-problem/) – Dynamic programming for optimal betting
- [gridworld-dp](./gridworld-dp/) – Policy evaluation and improvement using Dynamic Programming
- [gridworld-mdp](./gridworld-mdp/) – MDP formulation and planning
- [infinite-variance](./infinite-variance/) – Off-policy learning and variance analysis
- [random-walk](./random-walk/) – TD(0) vs Monte Carlo prediction
- [ten-armed-testbed](./ten-armed-testbed/) – Multi-armed bandits with ε-greedy strategy
- [tic-tac-toe](./tic-tac-toe/) – Self-play using state-value learning
- [windy-gridworld](./windy-gridworld/) – SARSA learning in stochastic grid environment

Each project may contain **notebooks**, **scripts**, and **configuration files** specific to its implementation.

## **🚀 Getting Started**

To explore any of the RL projects:

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/LilithMnatsakanyan/Reinforcement-Learning.git  
cd Reinforcement-Learning  
```

### 2️⃣ **Navigate to a Specific Project**
```sh
cd project-1  
```

### 3️⃣ **Install Dependencies**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

### 4️⃣ **Run the Project**
Depending on the project structure, run the main script:
```sh
python main.py  # Or train.py depending on the project  
```
