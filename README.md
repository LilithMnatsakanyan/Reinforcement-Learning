# **Reinforcement Learning Projects**  

This repository contains multiple **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** projects, each exploring different environments, techniques, and learning strategies. The primary goal is to experiment with RL concepts, build structured implementations, and improve my understanding of:  

- **Agent training** and policy optimization  
- **Reward functions** and environment interactions  
- **Decision-making** in dynamic and stochastic environments  

Each project is designed to demonstrate specific RL techniques and methodologies, helping to build a deeper intuition for training intelligent agents.

## **📌 Projects Overview**  

Each project is organized into its own folder, with a dedicated `README.md` explaining:  
✅ **Objectives** – The purpose of the project  
✅ **Methodology** – Algorithms and techniques used  
✅ **Key Findings** – Observations and results

## **🚀 Getting Started**  

To explore any of the RL projects:  

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/LilithMnatsakanyan/Reinforcement-Learning.git  
cd Reinforcement-Learning  
```

### 2️⃣ **Navigate to a Specific Project**  
```sh
cd project-1

```

### 4️⃣ **Run the Project**  
Depending on the project structure, run the main script:  
```sh
python main.py  # Or train.py depending on the project  
```
