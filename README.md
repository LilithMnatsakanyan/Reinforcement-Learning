# **Reinforcement Learning Projects**
This repository contains multiple **Reinforcement Learning (R
L) projects**, each focusing on different environments, techni
ques, and learning strategies. The goal is to experiment with
RL concepts, build structured implementations, and improve my
understanding of **agent training, reward optimization, and de
cision-making in dynamic environments**.
## **Projects Overview**
Each project is organized in its own folder with a dedicated `
README.md` explaining its objectives, methodology, and key fin
dings.

## **Getting Started**
To explore any of the RL projects:
1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/reinforcement-le
arning-projects.git
cd reinforcement-learning-projects
2. **Navigate to a specific project folder**:
cd project-1
3. **Install dependencies** (each project has its own requirem
ents.txt):
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the project**:
python main.py # Or train.py depending on the project
**Projects Included**
- **Basic RL Implementations** – Foundational concepts applied
to simple environments.
- **Agent Training** – Experiments with different reward struc
tures and learning policies.
- **Custom Environments** – Simulating unique scenarios for RL
models.
- **Evaluation and Optimization** – Analyzing performance and
tuning hyperparameters.
Each project's README.md contains details on its approach, cha
llenges, and improvements.
